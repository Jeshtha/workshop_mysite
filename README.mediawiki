This is a git repository you can fork if you are creating a
Django website on alwaysdata.com.

I ran just a few commands to create it. You can see them from
"git log".

To use:

* Fork this into your own Github account

* Clone your new Github repository to your own computer

* Also clone the Github repository to alwaysdata.com

* Make changes on your own computer, and push to Github.

* When you're ready to deploy:

 ssh yourusername@ssh.alwaysdata.com
 cd mysite
 git pull
